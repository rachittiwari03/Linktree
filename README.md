# What is Linktree?
Linktree is a popular web tool that allows users to create a simple, single-page landing page containing multiple links. It is often used by individuals and businesses, particularly those with a strong online presence, to showcase and provide easy access to various social media profiles, websites, online stores, blog posts, and more. Instead of sharing multiple links separately, Linktree consolidates them into a single link, simplifying the process of directing visitors to different online destinations. 

What have I done to my Linktree page?
I have included my personal, social, and professional links on it.
